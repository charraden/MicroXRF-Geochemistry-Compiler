convert the multiple, elemental exported text files from the Bruker ESPRIT software into a single table assigning relative coordinates to preserve the spatial relationships of the pixels to one another.
This Jupyter Notebook is designed to take elemental data exported from the Bruker software ESPRIT and subsequently converted to a wide format geochemical table (per Harraden et al, 2024, in prep). 
Details and step-by-step instructions on how to use the notebook are available in the downloads.
